*I learned that the most important thing in writing code is to make it as simple as possible and to keep focusing on that the developer should: ask him/herself always if the code is easy to understand or not, understand the purpose of the software, etc.
also, I learned some ways that make any code complex, such as: expecting the future, showing off the developers how they are smart, looking for perfection, not testing the code, etc.*
